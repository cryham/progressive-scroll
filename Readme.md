# Progressive Scroll

Visual Studio 2010-2013 extension which mimics [Metalscroll](https://code.google.com/archive/p/metalscroll/).

ProgressiveScroll is a MetalScroll clone for VS2010 and higher.  
It replaces the scrollbar with a graphic representation of the code.

Features:
* Double clicking highlights the selected word in the editor and the scrollbar.
* Pressing Escape clears the highlights.
* Coloring options for whitespace, comments, strings, highlights, bookmarks and breakpoints. These can be found in Tools > Options > Fonts and Colors.
* Adjustable width (This and other settings can be found under Tools > Options > Progressive Scroll).
* Uses the space that is usually wasted in the bottom right corner of the editor and hides the splitter control in the top right corner.

Warning! Does not work well with word wrap.
